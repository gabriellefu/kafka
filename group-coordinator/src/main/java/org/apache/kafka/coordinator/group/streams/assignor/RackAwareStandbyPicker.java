/**
 * Picks the candidate tag groups for each standby of one task. A tag group meets the condition of a tag key of
 * {@code rack.aware.assignment.tags} when its value for the tag key is new to the task. Starting from the tag groups
 * with room, each tag key in priority order narrows the candidates to those that meet its condition, or is given up if
 * none would be left; the assignor's tie-break then decides among them. Once every tag key is given up, the assignor's
 * tag-blind pass places the remaining standbys.
 * <p>
 * A {@link TagTree} records the values that the holders of the task carry and finds, without testing every tag group,
 * whether a tag group with room meets a set of conditions and the least-loaded process with room of those that do.
 * <p>
 * One picker per task, on the tree of the assignment: build it with the holders of the task, then per standby call
 * {@link #pick()}, stopping once it returns no conditions; let the assignor choose among the candidates under them, by
 * {@link #isCandidate(TagGroup, List)} or {@link #leastLoaded(List)}; and call {@link #markUsed(TagGroup)} for its
 * choice.
